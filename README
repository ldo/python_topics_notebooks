This repository contains [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks that
delve into the intricacies of some features of the Python language.

If you are new to Jupyter/IPython, use the command

> jupyter-notebook

in the current directory to start a Jupyter session. Jupyter’s mini
webserver will listen on port 8888 on your local machine; connect
using your web browser to see the available notebooks to open them and
start interacting with them. In particular, click in a Python code
cell and press shift-enter to execute the code. The code cells in
these notebooks are designed to be executed in sequence. Or, if you’re
lazy, you can do “Cell → Run All” when you open a notebook.

More information is available via the Help menu in the notebook
browser window.

Some of these notebooks need packages installed beyond the ones in
the standard Python library; this is noted where relevant at the
start of the notebook.
