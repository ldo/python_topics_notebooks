    "# Defining (Almost) Custom Operators #\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lets you add [custom overloads](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) for its built-in operators, but it doesn’t let you create entirely new operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in computer graphics, it is common to perform arithmetic operations on 3D [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space), representing positions, movements and directions in space. Commonly found among these operations are 3 different kinds of multiplication. It is natural to overload Python’s “`*`” operator for elementwise multiplication of two vectors, or multiplication of a vector by a scalar, while the “`@`” operator added in version 3.5 was specifically intended for representing the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product). However, this still leaves no suitable operator to use for the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product). The conventional mathematical symbol for the cross product, “`×`”, is not (currently) part of valid Python syntax. One could suggest picking some other Python operator at random, but this raises the surprise factor, as well as the inconvenience of the wrong operator precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the usual approach is to give up, and define a method with a boring name like “`cross()`”, so that a mathematical expression like “$v_1 \\times v_2$” gets translated in Python as “`v1.cross(v2)`”.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a way to do better than this.\n"
