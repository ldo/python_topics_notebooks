The `dict` class defines [a pop method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict) that removes and returns an entry with a specified key; this call also raises `KeyError` if the key is not present, unless you specify a default value that is returned in this case.

You may think this could easily trip up someone transliterating expressions from C or other such languages to Python, but I am not aware of any real-world situation where this could be a problem.\n",

    "## Avoiding The `with`-Statement ##\n",
    "\n",
    "`with`-statements have their uses, for example for managing memory allocated by some lower-level library that is not creating Python objects. But I often see them used with files and temporary directories, e.g.\n",

    "The aim is that the `with`-statement guarantees that, in any situation short of process deletion or complete runtime context meltdown, the file will be closed and the temporary directory (and its contents) cleaned up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trouble is, this is not necessarily a good thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For files opened read-only, this is unnecessary anyway, because as mentioned in the previous section, the file will be automatically closed when the last reference to the file object disappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "For files opened for writing, I always have this concern about notifying the user as far as possible about any I/O errors. Because to fail silently could lead to data loss, where the user assumes that data has been saved, but it has not. So I always like to explicitly close such files:\n",

    "\n",
    "For temporary directories, the `with`-statement guarantees as far as possible that the temporary directory will disappear, even if an exception occurs. Trouble is, if an exception occurs, the contents of that directory could be useful for debugging purposes. So, as messy as it may appear, I like to explicitly clean up the directory myself:\n",
