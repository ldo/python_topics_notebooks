    "# `ctypes` Tips #\n",
    "\n",
    "[`ctypes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) is a very handy tool for building Python wrappers for shared libraries written for C or C++. In most cases, it is probably preferable to use this, rather than write an *extension module* in C or C++ to provide the Python API: it can take a lot of code to implement the necessary C/C++ wrappers to represent Python objects and methods, while this can usually be done directly in Python with a fraction of the effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the documentation for `ctypes` is quite comprehensive, there are a few subtle points that might not be clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python wrapper will typically need a lot of things from the `ctypes` module. Its own documentation page uses wildcard imports in the examples, which I prefer to avoid. Instead, I reference its exports by importing the module under a shorter name:"

    "Some libraries have their own systems for keeping track of reference counts of objects. It’s probably easier to avoid library objects having a reference count greater than 1; just let Python itself keep track of references to your Python wrapper object, and have your `__del__()` method dispose of the library object. Then the library object automatically exists for as long as your Python wrapper object exists."

    "## Round-Trip Object Mapping ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying library may implement several different types of objects, and objects of one type may hold references to objects of another type. There will likely be API calls not only to set such references to particular objects, but also to retrieve the current object references from the referencing objects. How do you map this back to Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Cairo, a drawing `Context` can have a current _source_ for computing rendered pixel values, which is a reference to a `Pattern`. You have a `set_source` call to set the source to a specified `Pattern`, and you have a `get_source` call to retrieve a reference to the last-set `Pattern`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy enough to wrap the `set_source` call in an equivalent Python method on the `Context` wrapper, which takes a `Pattern` wrapper and extracts and passes both underlying objects to the library call. But what about `get_source`? Ideally, if you already have a Python wrapper object for that `Pattern`, it would be good to return that, rather than create a new wrapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this would be to have a separate field in your `Context` wrapper which saves the last-set `Pattern` wrapper when the `set_source` method is called, then your `get_source` method can “cheat” and, rather than calling the Cairo routine at all, it simply returns the value of this field. This has some consequences I find undesirable:\n",
    "* it means the wrapper object has to be kept around, even if the user doesn’t need it.\n",
    "* it stands the risk of getting out of sync, if the user makes a direct call to the Cairo `set_source` routine via some other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a more elegant solution, where you keep a class variable in the referenced class (`Pattern`, in this case) which holds a mapping from underlying object references to the corresponding Python objects; then the `get_source` method can simply look up the returned value in this dictionary; if an entry already exists, it can return that existing wrapper, otherwise it can automatically construct a new wrapper, add it to the dictionary, and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further twist is to make this dictionary a `WeakValueDictionary`. That way, entries in it only exist for as long as the caller has other references to those Python wrapper objects; if the user gets rid of their own references, then they disappear from this mapping as well. This keeps memory usage for unwanted objects from growing without bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make this work, the constructor for the wrapper object has to be implemented entirely within the `__new__()` method, rather than using `__init__()`. This way, you can control whether a new wrapper object is created or not.\n"

    "## Constructors Versus Create Methods ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to the previous topic, I find it best to reserve the constructors for my wrapper classes for internal use, namely to construct wrapper objects around already-created library objects. Then I provide a separate set of `create()` methods (typically defined as `classmethod`s), which do the creation of library objects and call the constructor internally as appropriate, returning the newly-created wrapper for the newly-created library object. This way, the constructor centralizes all the mechanism for mapping underlying library objects to corresponding wrapper objects.\n"

    "There are certain situations where you might construct a `ctypes` object on the fly, directly in a call to a low-level library routine. This can mean that the only reference to the object disappears, and the object is reclaimed, before the library routine gets a chance to use it.\n",

    "There is a drawback with custom `__del__()` methods on Python objects, which surfaces at program exit time: **there are no guarantees about the order in which they are called at exit time**. For example, if the underlying library object has already been deleted, then attempts to call disposal routines can cause intermittent segfaults. Of course, at times other than program termination, `__del__()` cleanup should continue to work OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is for your wrapper module to install an `atexit` cleanup routine which **deletes the `__del__()` methods from all your classes that have them**. At the time that `atexit` routines are called, the state of things is still guaranteed to be sane; they will only go to pieces afterwards. For example, in my Cairo wrapper above, among the last few lines of code is something like\n",
