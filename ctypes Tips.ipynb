    "\n",
    "[`ctypes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) is a very handy tool for building Python wrappers for shared libraries written for C or C++. In most cases, it is probably preferable to use this, rather than write an *extension module* in C or C++ to provide the Python API: it can take a lot of code to implement the necessary C/C++ wrappers to represent Python objects and methods, while this can usually be done directly in Python with a fraction of the effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the documentation for `ctypes` is quite comprehensive, there are a few subtle points that might not be clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python wrapper will typically need a lot of things from the `ctypes` module. Its own documentation page uses wildcard imports in the examples, which I prefer to avoid. Instead, I reference its exports by importing the module under a shorter name:"

It’s probably easier to avoid library objects having a reference count greater than 1; just let Python itself keep track of references to your Python wrapper object, and have your `__del__()` method dispose of the library object.

    "The underlying library may implement several different types of objects, and objects of one type may hold references to objects of another type. There will likely be API calls not only to set such references to particular objects, but also to retrieve the current object references from the referencing objects. How do you map this back to Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Cairo, a drawing `Context` can have a current _source_ for computing rendered pixel values, which is a reference to a `Pattern`. You have a `set_source` call to set the source to a specified `Pattern`, and you have a `get_source` call to retrieve a reference to the last-set `Pattern`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy enough to wrap the `set_source` call in an equivalent Python method on the `Context` wrapper, which takes a `Pattern` wrapper and extracts and passes both underlying objects to the library call. But what about `get_source`? Ideally, if you already have a Python wrapper object for that `Pattern`, it would be good to return that, rather than create a new wrapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this would be to have a separate field in your `Context` wrapper which saves the last-set `Pattern` wrapper when the `set_source` method is called, then your `get_source` method can “cheat” and, rather than calling the Cairo routine at all, it simply returns the value of this field. This has some consequences I find undesirable:\n",
    "* it means the wrapper object has to be kept around, even if the user doesn’t need it.\n",
    "* it stands the risk of getting out of sync, if the user makes a direct call to the Cairo `set_source` routine via some other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a more elegant solution, where you keep a class variable in the referenced class (`Pattern`, in this case) which holds a mapping from underlying object references to the corresponding Python objects; then the `get_source` method can simply look up the returned value in this dictionary; if an entry already exists, it can return that existing wrapper, otherwise it can automatically construct a new wrapper, add it to the dictionary, and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further twist is to make this dictionary a `WeakValueDictionary`. That way, entries in it only exist for as long as the caller has other references to those Python wrapper objects; if the user gets rid of their own references, then they disappear from this mapping as well. This keeps memory usage for unwanted objects from growing without bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make this work, the constructor for the wrapper object has to be implemented entirely within the `__new__()` method, rather than using `__init__()`. This way, you can control whether a new wrapper object is created or not.\n"

Of course, at times other than program termination, `__del__()` cleanup should continue to work OK.\n",
