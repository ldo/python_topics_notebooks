    "It is easy to convert just about any Python object to a string representation, using one of the [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str), [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr) or [`ascii()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ascii) functions. But sometimes you need more control, particularly over field widths, numbers of digits/characters, sign representations and the like.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where *formatted* string output comes in. As of version 3.6, Python offers no less than *three* different ways, built into the language, of doing formatted string output:\n",
    "* the traditional [C-style](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html) [`printf`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting) form, predating Python 3.0\n",
    "* the [`str.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings) method\n",
    "* [formatted string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-498-formatted-string-literals), reminiscent of those in Perl, introduced in Python 3.6.\n",

    "Python doesn’t actually provide a direct `printf` equivalent: instead, it provides the equivalent of `sprintf`, which returns the formatted string as the result, in the form of the “`%`” operator with a string as its left operand, and the sequence of items to be substituted as its right operand. It is then up to you to do what you want with this string: you can print it out, or assign it to something for later use, or manipulate it further in an expression.\n",
